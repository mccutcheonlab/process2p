# process2p

This code is used to preprocess tiff files generated by a two-photon microscope. It can (1) download tiffs from an Azure storage location using data in a experimental metafile, (2) process tiffs using imageJ to find the maximum Z-projection and save into chunks for further processing, and (3) use suite2p to perform registration and cell detection.

Raw and processed files are saved with a file structure as recommended by xxx.


## Usage/Examples

Navigate into the `src` directory and run the program from the command line.

It is recommended to run the script on a machine with at least 64GB RAM and a GPU.
